# How to Navigate My Personal Projects Folder üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome! This folder contains the personal projects I‚Äôve worked on outside of structured learning paths. Here's a quick guide to help you explore and understand my work.

## What‚Äôs Inside?

This folder is organized into two main categories:
1. **Active Projects**: Ongoing projects that I‚Äôm currently developing.
2. **Finished Projects**: Completed projects that showcase my skills and creativity.

Each project has its own folder with all the relevant files and documentation.
