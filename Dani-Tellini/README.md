# Welcome to Dani Tellini's Folder 👩‍💻

Hi there! I'm Dani, a fellow Codecademy learner and one of the admins for this study group. I created this folder to share my projects, notes, and resources as I progress through our learning journey. This is also a space where I'll document my growth and contribute to our collaborative efforts. 🌟

## About Me

I'm a passionate learner focusing on Front-End development. As a group admin, I'm here to support everyone in staying motivated and making progress together.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions, want to collaborate, or just need some encouragement! 🚀
