# How to Use Your Personal Projects Folder 🛠️

Welcome! This folder is your personal space within our repository. Here, you can organize and showcase the projects you’re working on, whether they’re active or completed. Think of it as your own coding portfolio within the study group!

---

## What Should You Include?

1. **Active Projects**  
   - Add projects you’re currently working on or developing.  
   - Organize your files and folders logically to make it easy for others to follow.  
   - Include a `README.md` or text file in each project folder with:  
     - A brief description of the project.  
     - Technologies and tools used.  
     - Any specific instructions (e.g., how to run the project).  

2. **Finished Projects**  
   - Showcase completed projects that you’re proud of!  
   - Include a `README.md` file with:  
     - An overview of the project and its purpose.  
     - Key features or functionality.  
     - Challenges you faced and what you learned.  
     - Links to live demos or external repositories, if applicable.

## Folder Structure Example

Here’s an example of how you might organize your folder:

```
Personal-Projects/
├── Active/
│   ├── Project-1/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── main.py
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Project-2/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   └── ...
├── Finished/
│   ├── Project-3/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── app.js
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Project-4/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── styles.css
│   │   └── ...
└── this README.md #Update this however you'd like!
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep It Organized**  
   - Use clear and descriptive folder names for your projects.  
   - Avoid clutter—delete unnecessary files before committing.  

2. **Document Everything**  
   - Add a `README.md` file to each project explaining its purpose and how it works.  
   - Mention any external libraries, tools, or dependencies used.  

3. **Keep It Updated**  
   - Move projects from “Active” to “Finished” as you complete them.  
   - Regularly update your folder to reflect your latest progress.
