# CodingBuddies

Welcome to the Coding Buddies repository! ðŸŽ‰ This is a collaborative space for learners from Codecademy who are dedicated to mastering coding concepts together. Our study group is aligned with the resources and learning paths provided by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh), as well.

## How It Works

This repository will folders for each of you to submit your projects that you complete. In each folder, you will have a Codecademy folder to be used for Codecademy Projects if you wish to add them to this repository, and a roadmap.sh folder for completed projects from this website.
