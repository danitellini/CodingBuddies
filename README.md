# CodingBuddies

Welcome to the Coding Buddies repository! ðŸŽ‰ This is a collaborative space for learners from Codecademy who are dedicated to mastering coding concepts together. Our study group is aligned with the resources and learning paths provided by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh), as well.

## Folder Structure

This repository will contain folders for each of you to submit your projects that you complete. In your folder, you will have a `Codecademy-Projects` folder to be used for Codecademy Projects if you wish to add them to this repository, and a `roadmap.sh-Projects` folder for completed projects from this website.

Think of this as a portfolio for you as individuals, and for us as a group. Who knows, maybe we'll create a massive project together one day!

## How It Works

There are a couple ways to submit your projects:

1. Fork this repository, create a new branch in _your_ new 'Roadmap.sh-CodingBuddies' repository, and commit your projects to this new branch in _your_ remote repository. Then, create a pull request to the groups remote repository to have it submitted into your folder!

2. Create a new branch in _this_ remote repository, commit your projects to this new branch in _this_ remote repostiory, and then submit a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch. 

> **Note**: If you are unsure about how GitHub works and would like a tutorial, you can either complete [this Codecademy GitHub course](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-git) or you can schedule a meeting with me [here](https://calendly.com/danitellini/meetwithdani).
