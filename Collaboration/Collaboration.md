# Welcome to the Collaboration Folder! 🤝✨

This folder is dedicated to group projects and collaborative efforts within our study group. Whether you’re teaming up for a Codecademy project, a roadmap.sh task, or just brainstorming ideas, this is the space to make it happen.

## How to Use This Folder

1. **Start a New Collaboration**:  
   - Create a subfolder for your project with a descriptive name (e.g., `Team-Portfolio`, `API-Integration-Project`).
   - Add a `README.md` or text file to describe the project, goals, and team members.

2. **Organize Files**:  
   - Keep your folder structure clean and logical.
   - Use version control and commit changes responsibly if working with Git.

3. **Track Progress**:  
   - Use a shared document or markdown file to track tasks, progress, and milestones.
   - Clearly define roles and responsibilities for team members.

## Guidelines

- Communicate clearly and respectfully with your team members.
- Document your work to make it easier for everyone to stay on the same page.
- Share updates and ask for feedback in the Discussions page or project folder.
